# Notes

## Django Basics

**Points:**
* Fields are specified by class attributes. They are the only required part of a model defining the database fields.
* Built-in field types: TODO:
* `makemigrations`: figure out how to modify the database so django can store the data associate with any new models.
* `migrate`: synchronizes the database state with the current set of models and migrations.
* `createsuperuser`: create a superuser (admin).

## Misc

* Superuser name: `DeepWalter`
* Password: `have fun`
