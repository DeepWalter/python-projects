## Description

Learning Log is a web app that allows users to log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries as they
learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page should describe the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
