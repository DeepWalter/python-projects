## Code Design Details

### Main Logic

The main logic of the code is rather simple. After setting up the screen, we create an infinite loop for the interactive
game play. Inside the `while` loop, we

1. watch for keyboard and mouse events;
2. make changes accordingly;
3. update the screen.

Step 1 and 2 are closely related. In those steps, we watch for keyboard and mouse events, and then respond to them. In
the last step, we just draw all the updated objects, namely the bullets, ship, aliens, score board, and buttons, onto
the screen.
