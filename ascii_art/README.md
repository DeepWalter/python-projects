# ASCII ART

Generate ASCII art from graphical images.

## How It Works

The ASCII art is generated by splitting an image into tiles and replace the average RGB value of a tile with an ASCII
character.

* Convert image into 8-bit grayscale.
* Split the image into a grid of MxN tiles.
* Correct M to match the image and font aspect ratio.
* Compute the average brightness for each tile and then look up a suitable ASCII character for each.
* Assemble rows of ASCII character strings and print them to a file to form the final image.
